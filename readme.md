video for agnostic detection:

video for task 2 is in the repo as "shapes-video-result.mkv"

To compile the code, download and appropriately name the image and video files (the static image should be changed to "shape.png", the video of the shapes moving should be changed to "shapes.mp4", and the background agnostic video should be changed to "shapes-hard.mp4") and ensure they're all in the same directory as the rest of the code files.

Note: My performance for the agnostic detection was slow due to the filter used, which was the only way I was able to accurately trace and mark the centers of the moving shapes. Hopefully, as part of PennAiR, I'll learn better ways to solve the challenge!
